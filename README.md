# Mega2560-I2C-Master
A simple implementation of a Master I2C/TWI class in C++ for the Mega2560.
This is a part of a semester project on the 2. semester of the Bachelor of Engineering in Software Technology at Aarhus University.
See the I2C_example.cpp for an example of how to use the I2C Master. 
The implementation is pretty bare bones in its current state, and doesn't really handle any status codes.
This might be updated in the future.
It should work fine for other AVR MCU's which support I2C/TWI, but this haven't been tested.

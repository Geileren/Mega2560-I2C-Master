# Mega2560-I2C-Master
A simple implementation of a Master I2C/TWI class in C++ for the Mega2560.
This is a part of a semester project on the 2. semester of the Bachelor of Engineering in Software Technology at Aarhus University.  
It properly works for other AVR MCU which support I2C/TWI, but this haven't been tested.
